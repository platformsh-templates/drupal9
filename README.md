This template builds Drupal 9 using the "Drupal Recommended" Composer project.  It is pre-configured to use MariaDB and Redis for caching.  The Drupal installer will skip asking for database credentials as they are already provided.

Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework.

## Features

* PHP 7.4
* MariaDB 10.4
* Redis 5
* Drush included
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Composer-based build

## Post-install

Run through the Drupal installer as normal.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to Drupal 9 "Recommended" project as it is downloaded from Drupal.org or Packagist.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Composer library, [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
* Drush and Drupal Console have been pre-included in `composer.json`.  You are free to remove one or both if you do not wish to use them.  (Note that the default cron and deploy hooks make use of Drush commands, however.)
* The Drupal Redis module comes pre-installed.  The placeholder module is not pre-installed, but it is enabled via `settings.platformsh.php` out of the box.
* The `settings.platformsh.php` file contains Platform.sh-specific code to map environment variables into Drupal configuration. You can add to it as needed. See the documentation for more examples of common snippets to include here.  It uses the Config Reader library.
* The `settings.php` file has been heavily customized to only define those values needed for both Platform.sh and local development.  It calls out to `settings.platformsh.php` if available.  You can add additional values as documented in `default.settings.php` as desired.  It is also setup such that when you install Drupal on Platform.sh the installer will not ask for database credentials as they will already be defined.
